    "This assignment will have you working and experimenting with decision trees. Initially, you will be required to implement a decision tree classifier by choosing thresholds based on various impurity measures and reporting the scores. Later, you can experiment with the `scikit-learn` implementation of decision trees, and how various other parameters can be leveraged for better performance.\n",

    "The dataset is a very simple one, the [banknote authentication dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication). It has 5 columns, the first 4 are the features, and the last one is the class label. The features are the variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy of the [wavelet transformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_transform) image of the banknote. The class label is 1 if the banknote is authentic, and 0 if it is forged. The data is present in `bankAuth.txt`. There are a total of 1372 samples in the dataset."
